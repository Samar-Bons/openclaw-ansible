# macOS-specific system tools installation (Homebrew-based)

# Homebrew cask installs (.pkg-based apps like Tailscale, Docker Desktop) internally
# call `sudo installer -pkg ...`. Since brew itself refuses to run as root, we use
# become: false on all brew tasks — but that means brew's internal sudo has no
# password/terminal. This sudoers rule allows passwordless /usr/sbin/installer
# so cask installs work unattended.
